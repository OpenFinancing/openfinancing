# Housing Platform

The housing platform aims to make low carbon, affordable housing a reality with the help of blockchain based systems for ownership, a token ecosystem for interaction between various parties and trusted legal entities on the blockchain to resolve disputes in contracts.

Right now, the prototype contains two models:

1. Construction Bond
2. Living Unit Coop

Both these models are highly WIP and are rapidly evolving to match desired models. The chain might not use stellar in the future and might move to another blockchain system if found more suitable because a high degree of emphasis is placed on the token ecosystem and how various parties interact on the blockchain with the help of these tokens.
