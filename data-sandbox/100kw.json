Djiembe Mbeba, the school principal, has taken the role of originator and convened the community in 5 occasions. The agreed form of development is through a community-owned cooperative ‘Ubadu Energy Collective’ which is in early stages of incorporation and enlisting in the Rwanda Stock Exchange. The Africa Fund has agreed to place 20% of the total investment in a first-loss escrow, they are expected to formally sign when the project achieves stage 2. "

The government has considered the development of a coal plant and extension of its transmission lines, but the community has resisted due to the project’s high risk of carbon lock-in, and central government corruption. Decentralised solar microgrids in villages, such as the one proposed in Ubadu, can help bi-pass the need for centralised coal generation."
